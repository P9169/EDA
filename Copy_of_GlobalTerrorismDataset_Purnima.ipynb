        "Terrorism is characterized by the use of violence against civilians, with the expressed desire of causing terror or panic in the population. Terrorism is not unique to the 20th and 21st centuries.\n",
        "Terrorism existed in 18th century revolutionary France during the reign of terror,as well as among the Zealots of Palestine in opposition to Roman rule some 2000 years ago. Today, terrorist activity can be found in Israel, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, Colombia, and the United States, to name a few of particular concern here are the September 11 suicide attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the attempted attack that resulted in the plane crash in Pennsylvania."
